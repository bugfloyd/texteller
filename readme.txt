An all-in-one text message integration solution for WordPress and popular third-party plugins, supporting multiple SMS and messaging gateways.

== Description ==
Texteller is an all-in-one text message integration solution for WordPress, supporting multiple third-party SMS and messaging gateways.  
The plugin tries to integrate with almost all email triggers on the site to send text messages. You can also receive text messages with supported gateways.  

Texteller offers a separated member registration system and along with the complete integration with WordPress user registration, it fully supports most popular plugins, including WooCommerce customer registration and checkout process (there’s more to come). If enabled, users may be able to register on the site using their mobile number instead of email address.  

The plugin has a complete text message newsletter system with a detailed registration form which could be inserted on any page or post using WordPress Widgets or the shortcode. Members registered via newsletter form may have no user linked to them, in order to prevent conflicts with other third-party plugins and they become just members of your site’s text newsletter!

# REQUIREMENTS #  
Texteller needs PHP version 7.1 or above to give you the lite and smooth experience with the least effect on your website’s performance.  
You should also have a WordPress version 5.0 or above to use the plugin and if you are planning to use the WooCommerce integration features, you will need WooCommerce version 3.7 or above.  
To enable internationalization features like local calendar and date types, PHP Intl extension should be installed on the server.

2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Are you going to add more messaging gateways to the plugin? =

Definitely yes! Texteller will support most popular messaging gateways in the world in near future!

= Why the plugin uses separated member system instead of using WordPress users? =

Texteller has many features based on mobile number such as newsletter and messaging lists (coming soon). To prevent conflicts with other third-party plugins, we use a dedicated members database table. However, each member can be linked to an existing WP user.

= Is there any plan to support more plugins? =  

Of course! More plugin integration will be available in future updates. Some notable ones are: Easy Digital Downloads, Gravity Forms, Ultimate Member, etc.
